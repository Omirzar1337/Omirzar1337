I'm a software developer who loves to play around with code! Whether it's C++, Python, Lua, Java, HTML, CSS, JS... as well as observing human vulnerabilities. I'm always excited to learn new things and work on new projects. 


## What I'm doing right now

I'm working on:
- [Geiger-M√ºller Sensor](https://github.com/4Xsample/Idees-per-Arduino/tree/main/Geiger%20Web%20Esp32-C3) ‚ò¢Ô∏è

Check the repos or reach me if you want to know more about the projects (Or if you understand nothing)

## What do I play

Right now I'm mainly playing Valorant, Trackmania 2020 and TOTK
