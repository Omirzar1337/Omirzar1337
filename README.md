# Hey there, I'm Omirzar, the cowboy-programmer!

I'm a software developer who loves to play around with code! Whether it's C++, Python, Lua, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, or AJAX, as well as observing human vulnerabilities. I'm always excited to learn new things and work on new projects. 


# What I'm doing right now

I'm working on [Geiger-Müller Sensor](https://github.com/4Xsample/Idees-per-Arduino/tree/main/Geiger%20Web%20Esp32-C3)

Check the repo or reach me if you want to know more about the project (Or if you understand nothing)
